"A data-mining tool to retrieve DNA sequences for densely sampled taxa"

This is/will be a simple tool that exploits rOpenSci's 'taxize' package to data mine NCBI and retreive clades 
(within families) that are sufficiently densely sampled to produce reliable topologies and branch lengths.

This is useful for sister-species comparisons where dataset size is more important than including particular 
clades.
